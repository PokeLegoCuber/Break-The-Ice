  - deuzi says: Hello, are you the new student?
  - deuzi says happy: Welcome to our Tutorial Game!
  - deuzi says: My name is Deuzilene and I'll be your guide.
  - deuzi says normal: So you want to make a Visual Novel?
  - deuzi says: With RenJS you can easily make games just like this one.
  - deuzi says: RenJS is inspired by Ren'Py and based on PhaserJS.
  - deuzi says: If you are familiar with any of those you have an advantage.
  - deuzi says: And if not...
  - deuzi says happy: No problem!
  - deuzi says: RenJS is made so the text of your story is written intuitively like a movie script.
  - deuzi says normal: Once you learn the structure, there's no limit to what you can create.
  - deuzi says: Let's get inside and start right away.

    title: Chapter 1
    subtitle: The basics 
  - deuzi says: First things first, let's see what we need to start.
  - deuzi says: RenJS doesn't come or is tied to any particular IDE (integrated development environment).
  - deuzi says: That is, a program to read and edit the files of the game, like your story script.
  - deuzi says: It doesn't have to be anything big or expensive.
  - deuzi says happy: For example, my favourite is Sublime Text, a free lightweight and multiplatform text editor.
  - deuzi says normal: Another thing you will need is RenJS itself.
  - deuzi says: RenJS is a library that will manage the flow, assets and interactivity of your game.
  - deuzi says: And finally, you will need your game script, in a way that the library can understand.
  - deuzi says: As a study case, we will use this same game you're playing right now.
  - deuzi says: You can find a link to download it in this same page, probably.
  - deuzi says: The game files will include both the library and the script for the Tutorial Game.
  - deuzi says: So, have you downloaded it yet?
  - choice:
    - I have it!:
      - deuzi says happy: Great! What a hardworking student!
    - Not yet:
      - show deuzi: angry
      - deuzi says angry: What are you waiting for!?
      - deuzi says normal: Go do it, I'll wait...
      - choice:
        - I have it!:
          - deuzi says happy: Good! Let's continue.
  - deuzi says normal: Now, open the root folder of this game.
  - deuzi says: It should look like this.
  - show deuzi: AT LEFT WITH MOVE CONTINUE
  - show folders: AT 550,300 WITH FADE
  - deuzi says: There are four folders and a file.
  - deuzi says: RenJS is web based, that means the game runs as a webpage.
  - deuzi says: index.html is the page that contains this game.
  - deuzi says: You can play the game locally by opening this file with a web browser.
  - deuzi says: The folder named RenJS is where the engine's files are located.
  - deuzi says: And the folder libs contains the engine's external dependencies, like PhaserJS.
  - deuzi says: If you're making a simple game, you shouldn't worry about any of this.
  - deuzi says: The files that concern you as a writer are inside the Story folder.
  - deuzi says: These YAML files are what you will use to make your game.
  - deuzi says: YAML is a human readable data serialization language.
  - deuzi says: That means that the files contain data in a structure that you can read and write easily.
  - deuzi says: In any case, the most important thing about YAML files is that indentation is super important.
  - deuzi says: If you screw up the indentation the game won't even load!
  - deuzi says angry: So be very careful about it. Only two spaces per level!

  - deuzi says normal: Ok, that was a lot of information, don't you think?
  - choice:
    - Yes, I'm already tired:
      - show deuzi: happy
      - deuzi says: I was hoping you'd say that!
      - deuzi says: You can save from the quick menu here on the side and return later!
    - No, I want to know more:
      - show deuzi: happy
      - deuzi says: I knew it!
      - deuzi says: I have a feeling you're not stopping until you write your first story
      - deuzi says: Isn't that exciting?
  - show deuzi: normal
  - deuzi says: All right, I'm going to take a break anyways.
  - deuzi says: But I'm leaving you in good hands.
  - show deuzi: happy
  - deuzi says: Good luck!
