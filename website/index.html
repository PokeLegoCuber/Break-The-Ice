										<h3>What is ICE? </h3>
										<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are responsible for preventing illegal immigration and preventing the unlawful traffic of goods into the US. With an increased emphasis on securing the nation's borders, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expanding, as are other federal law enforcement agencies.</p>
										<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
										<p>More than 80 illegal immigrants were arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in New York over the past five days, officials said Thursday. ICE has been arresting people since the beginning of the summer and is sperating families because they are immigrants and deporting parents regardless of there kids. They are detaining them in camps, like they are animals which is inhumane. </p>

											"Nikola Tesla was an immigrant. So were Jospeh Pulitzer and Albert Einstein and Igor Stravisky. Rational, compassionate immigration reform is needed so that the next teslas and einsteins are not denied access to educational or entrepeneurial oppurtunities in the United States. The time has come." -John Greene

									<h3>Resources</h3>
									<p>1. Knowing your constitutional rights are very important and can save you from a terrible encounter,
								 The 5th amendment is the "Rights of the accused - a person accused of a crime is entitled to certain rights".
								 The 14th amendment is granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States—including former slaves and guaranteed all citizens “equal protection of the laws.” The 6th amendment- "Right to a speedy trial by jury and a lawyer". The Fourth Amendment establishes the right “against unreasonable searches and seizures.”</p>
									<p>There are also resources that can get you a free lawyer if needed.The New York State Office for New Americans has a hotline to connect immigrants to legal resources that they will be staffing this weekend: 1-800-566-7636.
									The New York Immigrant Family Unity Project (NYIFUP) is a city-funded program that provides free immigration legal representation to all immigrants who have been detained by ICE and have their immigration court hearings in New York City. The three organizations that administer NYIFUP are the Bronx Defenders, Brooklyn Defender Services, and the Legal Aid Society (New York City Office). Individuals should only contact these organizations for free legal services if they have a loved one who is already in ICE detention or is expecting imminent transfer to ICE detention.
